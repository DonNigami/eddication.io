"Create a premium product advertisement based strictly on the uploaded reference image(s). Analyze the product and determine whether a male or female model should be present. If a model exists in the uploaded image, preserve the same identity and have the model naturally hold, wear, or use the product depending on its category. If no model is provided, introduce a suitable professional model that matches the brand’s target audience. Design a luxurious, powerful CGI scene with cinematic lighting, refined reflections, elegant particles, and a high-end atmosphere. Render in hyper-realistic quality. Automatically generate a Thai CTA based on the product’s strongest value, displayed in bold typography with a premium gradient fill and a clean, well-balanced stroke."
